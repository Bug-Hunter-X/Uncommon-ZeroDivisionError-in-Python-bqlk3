# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a subtle `ZeroDivisionError` in Python that only occurs under a specific condition. This type of error can be more challenging to debug than a consistently thrown error.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The solution, which addresses the error and includes more robust error handling, is located in `bugSolution.py`.
